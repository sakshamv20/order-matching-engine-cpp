We're simulating how a **stock exchange** works — people place **buy** and **sell** orders, 
and if their prices match,the trade happens.


💻 Program Output:


Welcome to the C++ Order Matching Engine
Enter orders in format: buy/sell price quantity
Type 'exit' to quit.


The program welcomes the user and tells them to enter an order like:


buy 100 10


Which means:

> "I want to **buy 10 shares** at **Rs. 100** each."



 📝 Order 1: `buy 100 10`

* This is a **buy order**.
* User wants to **buy 10 units** at **price Rs. 100**.
* There are no sell orders yet →  nothing to match.
* So, this order is saved in the **Buy Order Book** and waits.

---

📝 Order 2: `sell 95 5`

* Now the user wants to **sell 5 units at Rs. 95**.
* The system checks:

  * Is there any buy order **willing to pay ≥ 95**?
  * Yes! We already have: **Buy Order at Rs. 100**
* ✅ So trade happens!


✅ Matched: Buy ID 1 with Sell ID 2 | Price: 95 | Quantity: 5


🟢 Meaning:

* Buy order ID 1 (for 10 units @ Rs.100) gets **5 units** from sell order ID 2 (@ Rs.95).
* **Price used = seller's price (95)**
* Buy order now has **5 units left** to buy.

 📝 Order 3: `sell 100 5`

* User wants to **sell 5 units at Rs. 100**
* System checks again:

  * Is there any buy order ≥ 100?
  * Yes! Buy Order ID 1 still has 5 units left, at Rs.100.
* ✅ Trade happens!


✅ Matched: Buy ID 1 with Sell ID 3 | Price: 100 | Quantity: 5


🟢 Meaning:

* Remaining 5 units of Buy Order 1 are now matched.
* Both orders (buy and sell) are **fully completed**.

📝 Order 4: `exit`

* User types `exit` → Program ends


Exiting Order Matching Engine. Thank you!




 FINAL SUMMARY:

| Order Type | Price  | Quantity | Action Taken                          |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Buy 100 10 | Rs.100 | 10 units | Matched with two sell orders          |
| Sell 95 5  | Rs.95  | 5 units  | Matched with buy order (partially)    |
| Sell 100 5 | Rs.100 | 5 units  | Matched with buy order (completes it) |



Key Points to Remember

| Concept         | Meaning                                            |
| ----------------| ---------------------------------------------------|
| Buy Order       | You want to purchase shares at a certain max price |
| Sell Order      | You want to sell shares at a certain min price     |
| Match Condition | Buy Price ≥ Sell Price                             |
| FIFO Logic      | First come, first served — if same price           |
| Matched Price   | Always uses **seller's price** in most exchanges   |
